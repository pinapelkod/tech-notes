Speed ⚡ Scale 📈 Security 🔐

With static site generators like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/why-gatsby/) you can build and compile the "fastest websites on the web even faster". No calls to the database, no generating HTML, and by using a [CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/) to replicate your files, you can get access to your content even faster. Adittionally, there are less vulnerabilities to worry about atleast when compared to a CMS solution.

### ➡️ Use Cases

There are several use cases for static site generators spanning industry, technology, user role, and site type. The Gatsby website lays them out pretty well [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/use-cases/). For my purposes, I am more interested in the integration with [WordPress](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/guides/wordpress/) as well as the ability to use [Markdown](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/guides/markdown/). I will use Markdown for my GitHub Pages [portfolio site](dev.pinapel.com), and use the WordPress integration to revamp my [WordPress Site](notes.pinapel.com) to reap some of the benefits offered by Jamstack architecture. Read more about the Jamstack architecture at [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/jamstack/).

### ➡️ Top 5️⃣ Static Site Generators

According to [Jamstack.org](https://jamstack.org/generators/), the following list of Static Site Generators has the most stars on GitHub. I am familiar with all five but its not necessary to learn all of them. Pick one and run with it. I recommend you choose between Gatsby, Next.js, and Nuxt.

1. Next.js
2. Hugo
3. Gatsby
4. Jekyll
5. Nuxt
